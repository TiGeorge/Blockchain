  <p>Assume that in addition to the scaling factor, there is a factor&nbsp;responsible for deallocating unnecessary memory after removing elements from the list. You will be given two factors: one for increasing and one for reducing the allocated memory. Following that will be queries for abstract addition and removal of clusters of elements.</p> 
  <p>Your task is to return the allocated memory&nbsp;for each 'count' query at that moment. Multiplication on a fraction is rounded up, division by a fraction is rounded down. The initially allocated memory is 2.</p> 
  <p><strong>Input:</strong> In the first line there's&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of queries and both the scaling (<span class="math-tex">\(\geq 1.1\)</span>) and downscaling (<span class="math-tex">\(\geq 1.1\)</span>) factors. Following that are queries of these types:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>add count;</li> 
   <li>remove count;</li> 
   <li>count.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>Output:</strong> For every 'count' query,&nbsp;write down the amount of allocated memory at the moment.</p>
